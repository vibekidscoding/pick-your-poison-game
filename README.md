# Pick Your Poison - Family Game (Czech)

All text is localized into Czech.

## Features

- **Family-friendly questions** – over 25 unique cards covering topics from animals to video games.
- **Simple UI** – bright colors, large buttons and playful animations.
- **No dependencies** – everything is in a single `index.html` file that can be opened locally or hosted using GitHub Pages.
